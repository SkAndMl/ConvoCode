They are the foundation upon which you build user interfaces (UI), which makes them the perfect place to start your React journey! You will learn What a component is What role components play in a React application How to write your first React component Components: UI building blocks On the Web, HTML lets us create rich structured documents with its built-in set of tags like <h1> and <li>: <article> <h1>My First Component</h1> <ol> <li>Components: UI Building Blocks</li> <li>Defining a Component</li> <li>Using a Component</li> </ol></article> This markup represents this article <article>, its heading <h1>, and an (abbreviated) table of contents as an ordered list <ol>. Markup like this, combined with CSS for style, and JavaScript for interactivity, lies behind every sidebar, avatar, modal, dropdown‚Äîevery piece of UI you see on the Web. React lets you combine your markup, CSS, and JavaScript into custom ‚Äúcomponents‚Äù, reusable UI elements for your app. The table of contents code you saw above could be turned into a <TableOfContents /> component you could render on every page. Under the hood, it still uses the same HTML tags like <article>, <h1>, etc. Just like with HTML tags, you can compose, order and nest components to design whole pages. For example, the documentation page you‚Äôre reading is made out of React components: <PageLayout> <NavigationHeader> <SearchBar /> <Link to="/docs">Docs</Link> </NavigationHeader> <Sidebar /> <PageContent> <TableOfContents /> <DocumentationText /> </PageContent></PageLayout> As your project grows, you will notice that many of your designs can be composed by reusing components you already wrote, speeding up your development. Our table of contents above could be added to any screen with <TableOfContents />! You can even jumpstart your project with the thousands of components shared by the React open source community like Chakra UI and Material UI. Defining a component Traditionally when creating web pages, web developers marked up their content and then added interaction by sprinkling on some JavaScript. This worked great when interaction was a nice-to-have on the web. Now it is expected for many sites and all apps. React puts interactivity first while still using the same technology: a React component is a JavaScript function that you can sprinkle with markup. Here‚Äôs what that looks like (you can edit the example below): App.jsApp.js ResetForkexport default function Profile() { return ( <img src="https://i.imgur.com/MK3eW3Am.jpg" alt="Katherine Johnson" /> ) } And here‚Äôs how to build a component: Step 1: Export the component The export default prefix is a standard JavaScript syntax (not specific to React). It lets you mark the main function in a file so that you can later import it from other files. (More on importing in Importing and Exporting Components!) Step 2: Define the function With function Profile() { } you define a JavaScript function with the name Profile. PitfallReact components are regular JavaScript functions, but their names must start with a capital letter or they won‚Äôt work! Step 3: Add markup The component returns an <img /> tag with src and alt attributes. <img /> is written like HTML, but it is actually JavaScript under the hood! This syntax is called JSX, and it lets you embed markup inside JavaScript. Return statements can be written all on one line, as in this component: return <img src="https://i.imgur.com/MK3eW3As.jpg" alt="Katherine Johnson" />; But if your markup isn‚Äôt all on the same line as the return keyword, you must wrap it in a pair of parentheses: return ( <div> <img src="https://i.imgur.com/MK3eW3As.jpg" alt="Katherine Johnson" /> </div>); PitfallWithout parentheses, any code on the lines after return will be ignored! Using a component Now that you‚Äôve defined your Profile component, you can nest it inside other components. For example, you can export a Gallery component that uses multiple Profile components: App.jsApp.js ResetForkfunction Profile() { return ( <img src="https://i.imgur.com/MK3eW3As.jpg" alt="Katherine Johnson" /> ); } export default function Gallery() { return ( <section> <h1>Amazing scientists</h1> <Profile /> <Profile /> <Profile /> </section> ); } Show more What the browser sees Notice the difference in casing: <section> is lowercase, so React knows we refer to an HTML tag. <Profile /> starts with a capital P, so React knows that we want to use our component called Profile. And Profile contains even more HTML: <img />. In the end, this is what the browser sees: <section> <h1>Amazing scientists</h1> <img src="https://i.imgur.com/MK3eW3As.jpg" alt="Katherine Johnson" /> <img src="https://i.imgur.com/MK3eW3As.jpg" alt="Katherine Johnson" /> <img src="https://i.imgur.com/MK3eW3As.jpg" alt="Katherine Johnson" /></section> Nesting and organizing components Components are regular JavaScript functions, so you can keep multiple components in the same file. This is convenient when components are relatively small or tightly related to each other. If this file gets crowded, you can always move Profile to a separate file. You will learn how to do this shortly on the page about imports. Because the Profile components are rendered inside Gallery‚Äîeven several times!‚Äîwe can say that Gallery is a parent component, rendering each Profile as a ‚Äúchild‚Äù. This is part of the magic of React: you can define a component once, and then use it in as many places and as many times as you like. PitfallComponents can render other components, but you must never nest their definitions:export default function Gallery() { // üî¥ Never define a component inside another component! function Profile() { // ... } // ...}The snippet above is very slow and causes bugs. Instead, define every component at the top level:export default function Gallery() { // ...}// ‚úÖ Declare components at the top levelfunction Profile() { // ...}When a child component needs some data from a parent, pass it by props instead of nesting definitions. Deep DiveComponents all the way down Show DetailsYour React application begins at a ‚Äúroot‚Äù component. Usually, it is created automatically when you start a new project. For example, if you use CodeSandbox or if you use the framework Next.js, the root component is defined in pages/index.js. In these examples, you‚Äôve been exporting root components.Most React apps use components all the way down. This means that you won‚Äôt only use components for reusable pieces like buttons, but also for larger pieces like sidebars, lists, and ultimately, complete pages! Components are a handy way to organize UI code and markup, even if some of them are only used once.React-based frameworks take this a step further. Instead of using an empty HTML file and letting React ‚Äútake over‚Äù managing the page with JavaScript, they also generate the HTML automatically from your React components. This allows your app to show some content before the JavaScript code loads.Still, many websites only use React to add interactivity to existing HTML pages. They have many root components instead of a single one for the entire page. You can use as much‚Äîor as little‚ÄîReact as you need. RecapYou‚Äôve just gotten your first taste of React! Let‚Äôs recap some key points. React lets you create components, reusable UI elements for your app. In a React app, every piece of UI is a component. React components are regular JavaScript functions except: Their names always begin with a capital letter. They return JSX markup. Try out some challenges1. Export the component 2.
